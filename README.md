# AccesFile-Java
This project was created for my usually activity and i was wondering, maybe someone need too.


## What is doing this program?

This program ".jar" is for acces a ./start.sh file. Just start jar and you will have a looping for your Server.

This is really good for people who are hosting servers with panel and when panel crash.

## **To be clear **: 



Jar acces ./start.sh file. File "./start.sh" is a looping file who restart your Server automaticaly.

You welcome. It's really good for people who really know how to use :P

## ** Them come With Maven ** 

This project come with pom.xml so you can compile easy with maven and rename from code "start.sh" with name of file what you need.





** ACTUALLY IS A COMMAND EXECUTOR. YOU CAN RENAME "./start.sh" FROM CODE AND USE FOR EXECUTING COMMANDS :D **
